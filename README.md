# spin_screen_model
This is a model made in Blender by me which you can 3D print and put together with couple of 2mm-5mm screws, ball bearing, slip ring, and possibly a drill, the premise of it is to create a 3D display based on LEDs rotating. 

It's important to keep in mind this is only the 'body', you also need PCB boards specifically designed for this task.

The 'propeller' size is flexible and therefore can be changed into a bigger one as to fit more LEDS.
